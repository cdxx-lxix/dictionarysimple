# Simple dictionary
Python + Tkinter + SQLite3 

As a novice I made a simple pure python 3 dictionary. 
Nothing fancy about it. Basic GUI and all the necessary functions for a dictionary. 
The code is dirty and I know it. I've got a big knowledge hole in refactoring and python itself.

It'll be my pleasure if you can help me upgrade its code.
